## Overview

This example demonstrates semantic similarity search using vector embeddings and HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing. It covers:

- Storing 384-dimensional vector embeddings (mimicking sentence-transformers)
- Creating and populating HNSW indexes
- Performing nearest-neighbor searches
- Understanding indexing performance and architecture
- Best practices for filtering and production deployment

## Implementation Status

### Current: jelmerk/hnswlib

ArcadeDB currently uses [jelmerk/hnswlib](https://github.com/jelmerk/hnswlib), a Java port of the original C++ HNSW implementation.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Mature, proven algorithm
- ✅ Supports multiple distance functions (cosine, euclidean, inner product)
- ⚠️ Java port has performance overhead vs native implementations
- ⚠️ Limited to single-threaded indexing
- ⚠️ Memory management through JVM

### Future: datastax/jvector

The ArcadeDB team is planning migration to [datastax/jvector](https://github.com/datastax/jvector), a modern Java-native vector search library.

**Expected improvements:**
- 🚀 Better performance (native Java, no port overhead)
- 🚀 Multi-threaded indexing support
- 🚀 More efficient memory usage
- 🚀 Better integration with Java ecosystems
- 🚀 Active development and enterprise support

**Timeline:** Pending upstream ArcadeDB Java implementation changes.

!!! warning "Python Bindings Impact"
    The Python bindings are thin wrappers around Java APIs. When ArcadeDB migrates to jvector, the Python API will remain the same, but you'll automatically benefit from improved performance.

## Key Concepts

### Vector Embeddings

Vector embeddings represent text, images, or other data as points in high-dimensional space:

```python
# Example with sentence-transformers
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # 384 dimensions
embedding = model.encode("This is a sample document")
# embedding is now a 384D numpy array
```

**Common dimensions:**
- **384D**: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (fast, good quality)
- **768D**: sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 (higher quality)
- **1536D**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (best quality, paid)

### HNSW Index

Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs enable fast approximate nearest-neighbor search:

```python
index = db.create_vector_index(
    vertex_type="Article",
    vector_property="embedding",
    dimensions=384,
    id_property="id",
    distance_function="cosine",  # or "euclidean", "inner_product"
    m=16,                         # connections per node
    ef=128,                       # search quality
    ef_construction=128,          # build quality
    max_items=10000              # capacity
)
```

**Parameters explained:**

- **dimensions**: Must match your embedding model
- **distance_function**:
  - `cosine`: Best for normalized vectors (text embeddings)
  - `euclidean`: Straight-line distance (image features)
  - `inner_product`: Dot product (when magnitude matters)
- **M**: Connections per node (16 typical, 12-48 range)
  - Higher = better accuracy, more memory
  - 16 is good balance for most use cases
- **ef**: Search beam width (100-200 typical)
  - Higher = better recall, slower search
- **ef_construction**: Build quality (100-200 typical)
  - Higher = better index, slower build
- **max_items**: Pre-allocated capacity

### Distance vs Similarity

**Cosine Distance** (used in this example):
- Formula: `distance = 1 - cosine_similarity`
- Range: [0, 2]
  - 0 = identical vectors (same direction)
  - 1 = orthogonal vectors (unrelated)
  - 2 = opposite vectors (negation)
- Best for normalized vectors where direction matters

**Cosine Similarity** (for reference):
- Formula: `similarity = dot(a, b) / (norm(a) * norm(b))`
- Range: [-1, 1]
  - 1 = identical
  - 0 = orthogonal
  - -1 = opposite

## Architecture & Performance

### Index Structure

When you create and populate a vector index, ArcadeDB stores:

**Files created** (for 10K documents, 384D, M=16):
```
Article_414002873519545.5.v0.hnswidx         4 KB   (metadata only)
Article_0.1.65536.v0.bucket                 24 MB   (vertices + embeddings)
Article_0_in_edges.3.65536.v0.bucket        22 MB   (incoming edges)
Article_0_out_edges.2.65536.v0.bucket       22 MB   (outgoing edges)
VectorProximity0_0.7.65536.v0.bucket        47 MB   (HNSW proximity edges)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                                     115 MB
```

**Key insight**: The `.hnswidx` file is tiny (4KB) - it only stores metadata. The actual HNSW graph is stored as edges in the database!

### Indexing Performance

**Batch indexing** (10,000 documents):
- Total time: ~130 seconds
- Per document: ~13ms
- What happens:
  1. HNSW algorithm runs in RAM (graph construction)
  2. Each document connects to M≈16 neighbors
  3. Bidirectional edges created (~32 edge writes per doc)
  4. Transaction commits write to disk (~9KB edges per doc)

**Why it's expensive:**
- Complex graph operations (finding best insertion point)
- Distance calculations at each level
- Writing edges to disk (bulk of the time)
- Sequential processing (single-threaded in current implementation)

### Search Performance

**Query characteristics** (k=5 nearest neighbors):
- Visited vertices: ~log(N) × ef ≈ 1,500-2,000 (not all 10,000!)
- HNSW navigates intelligently through graph
- Vertices loaded on-demand from disk
- Hot vertices cached by ArcadeDB's page cache

**Memory during search:**
- Query vector: ~1.5 KB (384 floats)
- Visited vertices: ~4 MB working set
- Page cache: Varies (hot data stays in RAM)
- Total: Scales logarithmically, not linearly with dataset size

## Production Best Practices

### 1. Incremental Indexing (Recommended)

**❌ Don't do this** (batch re-indexing):
```python
# Bad: Index after inserting all documents
with db.transaction():
    for doc in documents:
        vertex = db.new_vertex("Article")
        vertex.set("embedding", embedding)
        vertex.save()

# Batch indexing (slow, expensive)
result = db.query("sql", "SELECT FROM Article")
with db.transaction():
    for record in result:
        index.add_vertex(record.asVertex())  # 130s for 10K docs!
```

**✅ Do this instead** (incremental indexing):
```python
# Good: Index during insertion
with db.transaction():
    for doc in documents:
        vertex = db.new_vertex("Article")
        vertex.set("embedding", embedding)
        vertex.save()

        # Index immediately
        index.add_vertex(vertex)  # Only pays cost once
```

**Why it's better:**
- Pay indexing cost only once per document
- No separate batch indexing step
- Natural for incremental data ingestion
- Simpler code

### 2. Filtering Strategies

Vector databases face a fundamental challenge: **HNSW doesn't support pre-filtering**.

#### Option A: Oversample + Post-filter (Recommended)

```python
def search_with_filters(index, query_embedding, k=5, filters=None,
                       oversample_factor=20):
    """
    Search with metadata filters using oversampling.

    Gets k × oversample_factor candidates, then filters to k results.
    """
    k_oversample = k * oversample_factor
    candidates = index.find_nearest(query_embedding, k=k_oversample)

    if not filters:
        return list(candidates)[:k]

    results = []
    for vertex, distance in candidates:
        matches = all(
            vertex.get(prop) == value
            for prop, value in filters.items()
        )
        if matches:
            results.append((vertex, distance))
            if len(results) >= k:
                break

    return results

# Usage
results = search_with_filters(
    index,
    query_embedding,
    k=5,
    filters={"category": "tech", "year": 2024},
    oversample_factor=20  # Get 100 candidates, filter to 5
)
```

**Pros:**
- Works with single index
- Simple implementation
- Good for moderately selective filters (>1% of data)

**Cons:**
- Wastes computation on filtered results
- May not find k results if filter is very selective
- Need to tune oversample_factor

#### Option B: Multiple Indexes (For Static Partitions)

```python
# Create separate indexes per category
tech_index = db.create_vector_index(
    vertex_type="TechArticle",
    vector_property="embedding",
    dimensions=384,
    ...
)

science_index = db.create_vector_index(
    vertex_type="ScienceArticle",
    vector_property="embedding",
    dimensions=384,
    ...
)

# Query specific index
results = tech_index.find_nearest(query_embedding, k=5)
```

**Pros:**
- No wasted computation
- Smaller indexes = faster search
- Perfect for static categories

**Cons:**
- Index management complexity
- Storage overhead (N × 115MB per index)
- Can't easily combine filters

#### Option C: Hybrid (For Highly Selective Filters)

```python
# If filter results in <1000 documents, brute force
filtered = db.query("sql",
    "SELECT FROM Article WHERE category = 'tech' AND year = 2024")

if len(filtered) < 1000:
    # Brute force distance calculation
    results = []
    for record in filtered:
        vertex = record.asVertex()
        embedding = vertex.get("embedding")
        distance = cosine_distance(query_embedding, embedding)
        results.append((vertex, distance))

    results.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    return results[:k]
else:
    # Use HNSW with oversampling
    return search_with_filters(index, query_embedding, k, filters)
```

### 3. Memory Considerations

**RAM usage formula:**
```
RAM ≈ 4 bytes × dimensions × num_vectors × (1 + M/2)
```

**Examples:**
- 10K vectors, 384D, M=16: ~37 MB
- 100K vectors, 384D, M=16: ~370 MB
- 1M vectors, 384D, M=16: ~3.7 GB
- 1M vectors, 1536D, M=16: ~14.7 GB

**Note:** This is working set, not total database size. ArcadeDB uses page caching, so hot data stays in RAM while cold data is read from disk on-demand.

### 4. Choosing Parameters

**Start with defaults:**
```python
M=16, ef=128, ef_construction=128
```

**Then tune based on needs:**

**Higher accuracy needed?**
- Increase M to 32-48 (more memory, better recall)
- Increase ef to 200-300 (slower search, better recall)

**Faster build needed?**
- Decrease ef_construction to 64-100 (faster build, slightly worse index)

**Faster search needed?**
- Decrease ef to 50-100 (faster search, slightly worse recall)
- Decrease M to 8-12 (less memory, faster but less accurate)

   ✅ Created HNSW vector index
   ⏱️  Time: 0.163s

Step 5: Populating vector index with existing documents...
   ⚠️  BATCH INDEXING: One-time operation for existing data
   💡 Production Best Practices:
      • INDEX AS YOU INSERT: Call index.add_vertex() during creation
      • AVOID RE-INDEXING: Batch approach is for initial load only
      • FILTERING: Build ONE index, use oversampling for filters

```

## Testing Notes

The `test_vector_search` test in [`test_core.py`](https://github.com/humemai/arcadedb-embedded-python/blob/python-embedded/bindings/python/tests/test_core.py) validates:

- ✅ Vector property creation (ARRAY_OF_FLOATS)
- ✅ HNSW index creation with parameters
- ✅ Vector insertion (NumPy arrays or Python lists)
- ✅ Nearest-neighbor search
- ✅ Result ranking by distance

**Key findings from testing:**
- Index creation is fast (~0.16s) - just metadata
- Index population is expensive (~13ms per document) - graph building
- Search is efficient (logarithmic, not linear in dataset size)
- Works with both NumPy arrays and plain Python lists
- Distance values correct (cosine distance = 1 - similarity)
