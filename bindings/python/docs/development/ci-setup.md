# CI/CD Multi-Platform Matrix Setup

## Overview

The CI/CD workflows now support building and releasing across **6 platforms** for a total of **6 wheel packages** per release, all under the single `arcadedb-embedded` package.

## Build Matrix

### Single-Package Strategy

- **arcadedb-embedded**: All platforms (~155-161MB) - JRE bundled, no external Java needed

### Platforms (All Native Runners)

- **linux/amd64**: Linux on x86_64 (ubuntu-24.04, Docker build)
- **linux/arm64**: Linux on ARM64 (ubuntu-24.04-arm, Docker build)
- **darwin/amd64**: macOS on Intel (macos-15-intel, native build)
- **darwin/arm64**: macOS on Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3/M4 (macos-15, native build)
- **windows/amd64**: Windows on x86_64 (windows-2025, native build)
- **windows/arm64**: Windows on ARM64 (windows-11-arm, native build)

### Total Artifacts

**6 wheels per release**: 1 package × 6 platforms = 6 wheels

## Workflow Changes

### `test-python-bindings.yml`

- **Matrix**: `platform: [linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64, windows/arm64]`
- **Runners**: All native (no QEMU emulation)
  - ubuntu-24.04 (Linux x64)
  - ubuntu-24.04-arm (Linux ARM64)
  - macos-15-intel (macOS Intel)
  - macos-15 (macOS Apple Silicon)
  - windows-2025 (Windows x64)
  - windows-11-arm (Windows ARM64)
- **Jobs**: 6 total (one per platform for testing)
- **Artifacts**: `wheel-{platform}-test` (6 artifacts)

### `release-python-packages.yml`

- **Matrix**: `platform: [linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64, windows/arm64]`
- **Runners**: All native (pinned versions for reproducibility)
- **Jobs**: 6 build jobs + 1 publish job (7 total)
- **Artifacts**: `wheel-{platform}` (6 artifacts)
- **Publish Job**:
  - `publish-pypi`: Collects all 6 wheels and publishes to `arcadedb-embedded`

## GitHub Repository Setup Required

### 1. Create PyPI Trusted Publisher Environment

You need to create one environment in GitHub repository settings:

#### Environment: `pypi`

- **PyPI Package**: `arcadedb-embedded`
- **Trusted Publisher**:
  - Repository: `humemai/arcadedb-embedded-python`
  - Workflow: `release-python-packages.yml`
  - Environment: `pypi`

### 2. Steps to Create Environment

1. **Go to Repository Settings** → **Environments** → **New environment**
2. **Create `pypi`** environment
3. **Configure PyPI Trusted Publisher**:
   - Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
   - Add publisher for `arcadedb-embedded` (environment: `pypi`)

### 3. First Release Steps

1. **Register package on PyPI** (if not already registered):
   ```bash
   # Build a wheel locally first
   cd bindings/python
   ./build.sh

   # Upload manually to register the package
   pip install twine
   twine upload dist/arcadedb_embedded-*.whl
   ```

2. **Set up trusted publisher** on PyPI (see step 2 above)

3. **Push a test tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag 25.10.1.dev0
   git push origin 25.10.1.dev0
   ```

4. **Monitor the workflow**:
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Watch `Build and Release Python Packages to PyPI`
   - Check that 6 wheels are built and publish job succeeds

## Validation

### Expected Artifacts

After a successful release, you should see:

- **6 wheel files** on PyPI for `arcadedb-embedded` (one per platform):
  - linux/amd64: ~160.9MB wheel
  - linux/arm64: ~159.9MB wheel
  - darwin/amd64: ~157.8MB wheel
  - darwin/arm64: ~156.7MB wheel
  - windows/amd64: ~157.4MB wheel
  - windows/arm64: ~155.1MB wheel

### Test Results (CI run #96)

All 6 platforms passing 43/43 tests:

| Platform | Wheel Size | JRE Size | Tests |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| linux/amd64 | 160.9M | 62.7M | 43/43 ✅ |
| linux/arm64 | 159.9M | 61.8M | 43/43 ✅ |
| darwin/amd64 | 157.8M | 55.3M | 43/43 ✅ |
| darwin/arm64 | 156.7M | 53.9M | 43/43 ✅ |
| windows/amd64 | 157.4M | 51.5M | 43/43 ✅ |
| windows/arm64 | 155.1M | 47.3M | 43/43 ✅ |

**All platforms include:**

- 167.4M JARs (83 files, identical across platforms, gRPC excluded)
- Platform-specific JRE (47-63MB depending on platform)
- Native runners (no QEMU emulation anywhere)

## Cross-Platform Building

### Native Runners (No Emulation)

All platforms use native GitHub runners:

- **linux/amd64**: ubuntu-24.04 (Docker build)
- **linux/arm64**: ubuntu-24.04-arm (Docker build, native ARM64)
- **darwin/amd64**: macos-15-intel (native build)
- **darwin/arm64**: macos-15 (native build)
- **windows/amd64**: windows-2025 (native build)
- **windows/arm64**: windows-11-arm (native build)

### Build Time Expectations

- **All platforms**: ~5-10 minutes per build (all native, no QEMU overhead)
- **Total release time**: ~15-25 minutes (parallel builds)

### Performance Improvements

Previously used QEMU for linux/arm64:

- QEMU: ~15-20 minutes per build
- Native ARM64: ~5-7 minutes per build
- **3-4x performance improvement** by switching to native runners

## Testing Locally

### Test specific platform build locally:

```bash
cd bindings/python

# Build for specific platform (requires Docker for Linux builds)
./build.sh --platform linux/amd64
./build.sh --platform darwin/arm64
./build.sh --platform windows/amd64

# Check the wheels
ls -lh dist/
```

### Test all platforms (requires Docker):

```bash
cd bindings/python

for platform in linux/amd64 linux/arm64 darwin/amd64 darwin/arm64 windows/amd64 windows/arm64; do
  echo "Building $platform..."
  ./build.sh --platform "$platform"
done

# Should have 6 wheels
ls -1 dist/*.whl | wc -l  # Should output: 6
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Value 'pypi' is not valid"

- This error appears in the workflow file but is expected
- The environment doesn't exist yet in GitHub settings
- Create it as described in section 1 above

### Platform-specific JVM detection issues

All platforms now use platform-specific JVM library paths:

- Windows: `bin/server/jvm.dll`
- macOS: `lib/server/libjvm.dylib`
- Linux: `lib/server/libjvm.so`

### Wheel count mismatch

- The publish job validates that exactly 6 wheels exist
- If validation fails, check the build matrix jobs for failures
- Ensure all 6 platform builds succeeded

### Runner availability

All platforms use pinned runner versions for reproducibility:

- ubuntu-24.04 (guaranteed available)
- ubuntu-24.04-arm (GitHub-hosted ARM64)
- macos-15-intel (Intel Mac, pinned version)
- macos-15 (Apple Silicon, pinned version)
- windows-2025 (Windows x64, pinned version)
- windows-11-arm (Windows ARM64, GitHub-hosted)

## Next Steps

1. **Create GitHub environment** (`pypi`)
2. **Set up PyPI trusted publisher** for `arcadedb-embedded`
3. **Test with a dev tag**: `git tag 25.10.1.dev0 && git push origin 25.10.1.dev0`
4. **Verify 6 wheels are published** to PyPI (one per platform)
5. **Test installation** on all 6 platforms
6. **Verify no Java required** on end-user systems (JRE bundled)
